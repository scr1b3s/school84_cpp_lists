Forbidden functions: std::typeinfo

Implement a Base class that has a public virtual destructor only. Create three empty classes A, B, and C, that publicly inherit from Base.

These four classes donâ€™t have to be designed in the Orthodox Canonical Form.

Implement the following functions:

``Base * generate(void);``
It randomly instantiates A, B, or C and returns the instance as a Base pointer. Feel free to use anything you like for the random choice implementation.

``void identify(Base* p);``
It prints the actual type of the object pointed to by p: "A", "B", or "C".

``void identify(Base& p);``
It prints the actual type of the object referenced by p: "A", "B", or "C". Using a pointer inside this function is forbidden. Including the typeinfo header is forbidden.

Write a program to test that everything works as expected.
